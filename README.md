The soccer team needs to have at least 1 Goalkeeper (GK), 1 Striker (ST), 1 Midfielder (MD) and 1 Defender (DF). The additional player can be allocated to any outfield spot (ST, MD or DF).

Please use "npm install" to install all the dependencies and then use "npm start" to run the app.

Alternatively, using docker can run the file. After intalling docker, run "docker build -t marvel-soccer-team" and then run "docker run -p 8080:80 marvel-soccer-team". The app can be visited at http://localhost:8080
